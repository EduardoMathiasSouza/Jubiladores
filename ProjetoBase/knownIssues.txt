				num_vars/old_vars - change to a stack (4)
SOLVED: lexical level - constantly going up, should reflect the actual depth (3)
SOLVED: parameters - doesn't count the number of parameters required
SOLVED: parameters not updated on params list on declaration (1)
SOLVED: subsequent pass by reference should be by value (2)
				functions not implemented
SOLVED:	breaking with nested proc declarations

possible issues:
- label mismatch
- "desvio" empty



(1) - the code was updating some random variable instead of the procedure.
(2) - in case of: p(var x: integer); p(x) call inside p -> should be passed by value.
(3) - not an actual issue
(4) - somehow not an actual issue???
